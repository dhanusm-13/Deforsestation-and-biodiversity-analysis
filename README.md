# Deforsestation-and-biodiversity-analysis

🌳 Deforestation and Biodiversity Analysis

This project analyzes forest area, biodiversity, and drivers of deforestation across different states and years. Using Python, Pandas, and visualization libraries, it highlights trends, correlations, and extreme cases of forest loss.

📌 Features

Load and preprocess environmental dataset (1990–2023)
Identify states with highest and lowest forest loss per year
Explore impacts of agriculture, urbanization, mining, and logging
Generate correlation matrix between environmental indicators
Visualize findings with heatmaps and plots
Jupyter Notebook for reproducible analysis

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x
Pandas – data manipulation
Matplotlib / Seaborn – visualization
Jupyter Notebook – interactive analysis

📊 Example Analysis
Highest & Lowest Forest Loss per year (side-by-side comparison of states)
Correlation Matrix of forest area, biodiversity index, and drivers like agriculture, mining, urbanization, and logging
Trend Analysis across years (1990–2023)
